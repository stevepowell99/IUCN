Cultivés sous ombrage, le cacao est produit avec des externalités écologiques et économiques positives. Le prix est augmenté, en particulier grâce à l’obtention du label biologique. Associé à l’introduction d’essences d’arbres originaires de la zone et rares, la culture contribue à la fois à la conservation de la biodiversité et au stockage de carbone.
    A l’issue du projet, les objectifs sont d’augmenter de 30% les rendements du cacao et d’au minimum 30% les revenus agricoles par kilogramme de cacao livré.

                   2011 – 2012Ce film patrimonial sur les dernières forêts primaires et tropicales est né de l’association du botaniste Francis Hallé et du réalisateur Luc Jacquet. Il a pour but de sensibiliser les jeunes générations sur les forêts sauvages vierges. Au rythme actuel de la déforestation, ces forêts auront disparu dans dix ans. Pour augmenter l’impact de la sensibilisation, le projet est associé à des projets complémentaires et événementiels, et utilise les nouvelles technologies de communication.

                   Le Projet EcoMadera du Pinchot Institute est mis en œuvre sur la plaine côtière du Nord de l'Équateur, épicentre de la déforestation intensive en Équateur. EcoMadera a été mis en place dans le cadre d'un projet d'exploitation des forêts locales, afin de fournir une alternative économique à la déforestation. Le postulat de base de ce projet est que la stratégie de conservation la plus efficace consiste à relier les forêts aux marchés les plus rentables, pour que les communautés locales tirent de plus grands bénéfices des forêts qu'elles n'en ont à convertir ces terres à l'agriculture.En 2009, EcoMadera a fusionné avec des investisseurs et des techniciens locaux, dans le cadre d'une entreprise mixte locale à vocation forestière. L'entreprise gère une réserve forestière, des forêts de production, des zones de restauration forestière et des plantations. Elle produit actuellement des laminés de balsa, destinés à la construction de pales d'éoliennes. La prochaine phase consiste à augmenter de façon spectaculaire la surface boisée gérée de manière durable et à produire du parquet en bois dur pour les marchés de la construction ""verte"".

                   2010 – 2012Ce projet est la continuité d’une phase précédente soutenue par la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco et qui a permis de protéger plus de 3 millions d’hectares dans la forêt du Pérou- Amazonien en partenariat avec le gouvernement et les communautés locales.Il s’agit de mettre au point des projets REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). Les projets REDD ont comme objectif de lutter contre le réchauffement climatique provoqué, en grande partie (25%), par la déforestation et la dégradation des forêts.Ce projet, directement lié au marché carbone, permettra dès 2014 d’offrir des ressources financières supplémentaires aux populations locales afin de les inciter à préserver leur forêt. Il repose sur les taux de déboisement historiques, permettant de prévoir la déforestation future qu’il convient aujourd’hui d’éviter.La Fondation Prince Albert II, en s’impliquant dans ce mécanisme, a comme ambition de pouvoir répliquer cette expérience dans d’autres zones et poursuit ainsi son action de préservation des plus grands massifs forestiers tropicaux.

                   Le programme des Nations Unies pour l’environnement (PNUE) a lancé un programme autour du slogan « Plantons pour la Planète : la campagne pour un milliard d’arbres ». Cette initiative vise à encourager les citoyens de tous les pays, les communautés, les organisations et les gouvernements à s’engager à planter un certain nombre d’arbres et à enregistrer leurs contributions via le site de la campagne. L’objectif est de voir plantés au moins un milliard d’arbres à travers le monde en 2007.La campagne encourage la plantation d’arbres indigènes ou acclimatés au milieu local. Le site présente conseils et astuces pour planter un arbre et vous guide vers des associations partenaires, comme le Centre mondial de l’agroforesterie de l’ICRAF, capables d’offrir des conseils adaptés.

                   La forêt boréale constitue un des principaux domaines forestiers de la planète, et son permafrost un énorme réservoir de stockage du CO2.L’objectif du projet est de protéger de la destruction au moins 50% de la forêt boréale du nord Québec. La campagne internationale pour la conservation de la forêt boréale plaide avec des organismes de conservation, des chefs d’entreprise et les communautés ainsi que les chefs aborigènes afin que le développement du Nord du Québec soit précédé d’une planification de la conservation, qui préserverait au moins la moitié de cette région (environ 600 000 km2) sous forme de parcs, réserves et autres zones protégées.Après plusieurs années de cette campagne, le premier ministre Charest a adopté cette approche pour le « Plan Nord ». Ce projet apportera au Québec un soutien important pour le développement du « Conseil du Nord Durable ».

                   2007-2010Les forêts tropicales du bassin du Congo constituent une réserve unique de biodiversité pour la planète et stockent des millions de tonnes de carbone. 36% de la superficie de ces forêts est actuellement attribuée à l’exploitation du bois, mais seule une très faible partie est engagée dans la direction de la protection environnementale.Le Centre d‘Excellence Sociale pour les forêts du Bassin du Congo a un objectif triple : certifier 7 millions d’hectares de forêts en 2010 en impliquant 10 à 14 sociétés d’exploitation ; former environ vingt jeunes chercheurs en sciences sociales et humaines, et à la cartographie sociale ; insérer des modules de formation sur ces mêmes thèmes dans les cursus de formation des écoles forestières de l’Afrique Centrale.

                   2007-2010La forêt primaire tropicale et équatoriale est exploitée de façon intensive et de manière si peu contrôlée que la biodiversité des forêts de l’Asie du Sud-Est est fortement menacée. Parmi les 33 espèces de mammifères de l’île, 14 sont endémiques, ce qui représente 42 % des espèces de l’île. La recherche d’activités économiques alternatives pour les paysans qui vivent dans les derniers espaces sauvages restants est une façon de lutter contre la déforestation et également contre la pauvreté.Le SCP agit sur plusieurs fronts :- recherche et projets d’étude portant sur la biologie de la conservation de la génétique, l’éthologie et l’alimentation des primates endémiques des îles Mentawai.- conservation de la forêt avec la réalisation d’activités en collaboration avec les villageois, dans une optique de développement durable.

                   Depuis quelques années, le CO2 suscite un énorme intérêt en raison des déséquilibres que la hausse constante des émissions de ce gaz commence à produire sur notre climat. L’augmentation du CO2, soumise à un cycle qui s’auto-alimente, atteint progressivement tout l’environnement de la planète : l’oxygène présent dans les profondeurs de l’océan est en diminution, ce qui provoque l’extinction de la vie au fond des mers.En enterrant le CO2, l’Homme a trouvé des solutions d’urgence à court terme, mais il n’a encore trouvé aucune issue à long terme.  Le film étudie le phénomène naturel et universel d’augmentation du CO2 en observant ses effets. « Ennemi Public CO2 » fait un réel état des lieux des gaz incombustible, propose des solutions aux problèmes posé par le CO2 ainsi que présente les issues les plus catastrophiques qui nous attendent si rien n’est fait.

                   Ce projet consiste à étudier les effets de l’acidification des océans sur un écosystème naturellement acidifié. Cette approche innovante a été utilisée pour la première fois, en Méditerranée, à Ischia en Italie, sur un site volcanique d’émission de CO2 créant un gradient nature de pH acide affectant les écosystèmes benthiques.Ce projet s’intéresse aux réponses physiologiques adaptives d’organismes clés : deux gastéropodes communs, un mollusque et la plante marine. Des expériences de transplantation seront également réalisées calcification à l’aide du radioacteur 45Ca (AIEA).Les résultats permettront de mieux prédire les conséquences écologiques de l’acidification de l’eau de mer sur la biodiversité des communautés benthiques de Méditerranée.

                   Octobre 2008L’océan absorbe approximativement 1/3 du CO2 émis dans l’atmosphère par la combustion des carburants fossiles. Cependant, ce service précieux génère un fort coût écologique - l’acidification de l’océan.Il s’agissait de fournir un forum interdisciplinaire pour mesure ce que l’on sait de l’acidification des océans et pour définir des priorités pour les recherches à venir. Elaborée à l’issue du symposium, la « déclaration de Monaco », cosignée par 155 scientifiques originaires de 26 pays, présente des recommandations pour les décideurs politiques sur les enjeux de cette problématique.

                   2011-2014Sunlabob a mis au point un ensemble de lanternes rechargeables à l’énergie solaire. Dans chaque village, un entrepreneur recharge les lanternes portables et les fait circuler au sein des différents foyers du village en échange d’une cotisation.Le système a été conçu pour concurrencer et remplacer l’utilisation traditionnelle des lampes au kérosène. Il produit des emplois, crée des revenus et permet une meilleure implantation des micro-entreprises dans les zones déshéritées et non connectées au réseau électrique.

                   2010-2011Le projet a pour objectif la mise en place d’infrastructures semi-modernes, non polluantes, et autonomes, de conservation par le froid de denrées périssables.Destinées aux zones rurales non électrifiées des régions chaudes et sèches, ces infrastructures reposent sur un principe technologique de production de froid, basé sur le refroidissement radiatif couplé au stockage en chaleur sensible et à l’isolation thermique diurne.Ces infrastructures permettent une production de froid autonome, décentralisée et sans émission de gaz à effet de serre. Elles contribuent au développement du secteur agricole en associant au projet les paysans locaux.

                   2007- 2009A Kigali, seulement la moitié des déchets solides sont transportés dans des dépotoirs, tandis que le reste est abandonné dans des décharges sauvages disséminées à travers la ville, avec les conséquences sanitaires et environnementales qui en découlent.Le projet met en place une technologie innovante qui utilise ces déchets comme combustibles accessibles aux ménages pour la cuisson domestique.Le projet revêt également un caractère social. Tourné vers les femmes, il vise à leur donner du travail et un nouveau rôle à jouer au sein de leur communauté.

                   2009-2012Le programme a pour objectif général d’établir un cadre pour une gestion durable de la biomasse dans la province de Chefchaouen au Maroc. Jusqu’à présent, le bois était le seul combustible utilisable, ce qui a donné lieu à des problèmes de déforestation.Le but du projet est d’offrir l’autonomie énergétique aux populations rurales, en mettant à leur disposition des équipements performants qui utilisent la biomasse locale comme carburant.Ce projet permettra d’apporter des équipements de confort comme des cuiseurs solaires ou de l’eau chaude pour les sanitaires et le chauffage dans ces régions isolées.

                   2009 - 2011Ce workshop international interdisciplinaire a regroupé des experts économiques et scientifiques dans le but d’identifier les mesures et la façon de gérer durablement les écosystèmes en Antarctique, et de déterminer les zones dont le potentiel écologique et biologique devrait être considéré comme important pour la conservation éco-systémique. Il en est ressorti des recommandations à destination des décideurs politiques pour la gestion durable de ces zones. Les résultats des recherches scientifiques sur la faune et la flore, ainsi que sur la cartographie du terrain, ont été discutés, afin d’améliorer la compréhension de l’écologie de ces milieux.

                   Situé en République des Palaos, pays situé au milieu de l’Océan Pacifique, ce projet a pour but d’aider à la création d’un système de protection efficace et durable qui va permettre à la fois de gérer les menaces telles que la surpêche ou le changement climatique mais aussi de répondre aux besoins des communautés locales.En 2001, un programme test avait été mis en place par le gouvernement et les communautés locales afin de faire de l’atoll d’Helen Reef une aire marine protégée.En 2006, Conservation International a développé le système des « Accords de conservation » qui permettent à la fois d’améliorer la conservation de la biodiversité et de maintenir le niveau de vie des populations. Ces accords permettent :- la gestion durable des ressources- le développement de sources de revenus alternatives à la pêche- le développement de mécanismes de financement à long-termeAujourd’hui, la Fondation Prince Albert II s’est engagée aux côtés de Conservation International afin de travailler sur le point le plus critique de ces accords : la création d’un système de financement à long-terme. L’objectif principal sera de mettre en place un fond de dotation qui permettrait notamment de couvrir les frais financiers dits « réguliers » liés aux accords de conservation.

                    Description du projet                    
                
                   2012 – 2013 Le détroit de Lancaster marque l’entrée du passage Nord-Ouest en sortant de la mer de Baffin. En raison d’une topographie complexe et de la circulation de courants marins, cette zone d’upwelling est riche en nutriments et constitue l’une des aires marines les plus biologiquement actives. Le plus souvent non recouverte par les gales, elle est également l’un des plus importants sites de migration pour les grands cétacés. De larges populations narvals, bégoulas, baleines boréales, morses, phoques annelés, barbus et phoques du Groenland utilisent ainsi les eaux de détroit de Lancaster pour se nourrir, se reproduire et migrer.Face aux conséquences du réchauffement climatique et de la fonte des glaces, le projet « Oceans North Campaign » soutenu par la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco, vise à encourager le gouvernement canadien à désigner le détroit de Lancaster comme une Aire Marine Nationale de Conservation. Cette désignation très stricte, a pour but d’y interdire l’exploitation minière en eaux profondes, le développement de plateformes pétrolières offshore et de limiter la pêche industrielle dont les conséquences sur l’écosystème sont souvent ravageuses.Ce site d’une richesse naturelle exceptionnelle, a également toujours fourni des moyens de subsidence aux communautés Inuits qui participent aujourd’hui activement à sa protection. Ainsi, the Pew Charitable Trusts, en collaboration avec le gouvernement canadien et ces communautés locales, est en phase d’élargir cette initiative à d’autres sites candidats et espère identifier, dans les deux années à venir, trois nouvelles Aires Marines Protégées dans les eaux arctiques du Canada.

Ce projet a comme objectif de promouvoir l’importance de la création d’un réseau d’Aires Marines Protégées en Mer de Ross, zone intacte et extrêmement riche en biodiversité.Depuis 2 ans, ASOC a mené un lobbying mutlicanaux pour la Commission pour la Préservation de la Faune et de la Flore Antarctique (CCAMLR), qui est l’organisme de gouvernance environementale de l’Antarctique, valide la création de l’Aire Marine Protégée de la Mer de Ross.Cette campagne a été menée en sensibilisant le grand public avec le soutien de l’Antartic Ocean Alliance (AOA) mais également en effectuant un travail de lobbying auprès des différents pays les plus réticents à la création d’un réseau d’Aires Marines Protégées

                   La mer de Scotia et les mers entourant la Géorgie du Sud forment un écosystème unique dans l’océan Austral. La Géorgie du Sud, île du Royaume-Uni et d’une superficie de 3 755 km2, présente une faune variée de type subantarctique alors qu’elle se situe au sud du front polaire.Cette région constitue un refuge essentiel pour de nombreuses espèces très pélagiques. La protection de certaines d’entres elles représentent un enjeu crucial, il devient indispensable d’identifier et de protéger les habitats marins clés dans les eaux avoisinantes.Ce projet vise à utiliser les oiseaux et autres prédateurs marins comme des espèces indicatrices des zones sensibles de l’activité biologique marine dans la région de la Géorgie du Sud et de la mer de Scotia de l’océan Austral. Cette étude permettra de classifier et de délimiter à la fois les zones les plus pertinentes au niveau de la biodiversité mais aussi de définir la gestion la plus adaptée pour de futures aires marines protégées.

                   2007-2010Le Complexe Récifal de Toliara abrite divers habitats riches, notamment des récifs barrières, des récifs frangeants, des herbiers de zostères, des mangroves et des lagons. Les résultats préliminaires d'études réalisées le long de ce récif montrent l'importance des pressions exercées par les acteurs locaux, en particulier les pêcheurs.L'objectif du projet est de renforcer les activités déjà entreprises depuis 2005 et de contribuer à la mise en place effective d'une aire marine protégée.

                   Plus de 20% des émissions de gaz à effet de serre sont issus de la destruction des forêts tropicales qui entraine la dégradation des sols, la disparition de la biodiversité, et la perte d'identité des populations locales.La principauté entend apporter sa contribution en lançant une initiative pour la promotion de l'utilisation de bois certifiés en principauté et par des actions de sensibilisation pour le grand public.L'exposition « Richesse de la forêt tropicale », fruit d'un long parcours foisonnant de découvertes, de rencontres, de partages dans les forêts humides de la planète nous dévoile ces lieux fascinants mais très menacés, souvent méconnus et peu compris. Cyril Ruoso témoigne par ces photographies étonnantes d'un écosystème unique mais aussi d'un mode de vie, la culture pygmée Baka dont le sort est intimement lié à celui de la forêt. Avec ce voyage au cœur des forêts tropicales, nous découvrons un monde que nous devons absolument protéger.

                   2011-2013La richesse biologique et culturelle des Iles Salomon est menacée par l’extraction des ressources à grande échelle. La Fondation Prince Albert II a souhaité œuvrer en faveur des efforts de conservation communautaires entrepris dans ces sites : pour cela, elle soutient le partenariat entre l’American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) et l’association SICCP (Solomon Islands Community Conservation Partnership) qui regroupe les communautés traditionnelles de propriétaires terriens locaux.Ce programme a pour but de renforcer les initiatives dans des zones protégées existantes, en mettant en place des partenariats qui permettent aux propriétaires terriens de bénéficier de revenus et de formations sur la biodiversité en échange de leur participation aux efforts de conservation.

                   « Une mer au milieu des terres », comme son nom l’indique ; la Méditerranée se présente comme un immense lac, creuset de cultures et berceau de la civilisation occidentale.Sa situation stratégique, ses côtes extrêmement découpées, son climat propice expliquent tout à la fois son importance dans l’histoire de l'humanité et sa place actuelle. Sa faune et sa flore sont également exceptionnelles.Cette mer représente moins d'1% de la surface des océans de la Terre, pourtant elle renferme 10% des espèces vivantes marine... Toutefois cette mer est fragile, les atteintes sont nombreuses (pollutions multiples, surpêche, bétonnage des côtes, dégazage sauvage, etc..), sa biodiversité est ainsi menacée. Engagez-vous à nos côtés pour la préserver !

                   2008-2010Ce projet, réalisé par deux auteurs locaux, Ludovic Thébault et Lionel Charles, constitue une véritable et inédite synthèse des connaissances actuelles sur la flore des Alpes Maritimes.Ce livre traite de la flore sauvage mais également des principales espèces introduites ou cultivées. Toutes les espèces citées ont été photographiées et enrichies d’une carte de répartition, rendant l’utilisation du guide facile et ludique.En complément du livre, un cédérom, simple de navigation et interactif, est mis à disposition pour faciliter les recherches de chaque utilisateur.

                   2009Cette exposition qui met à l’honneur les parcs du Mercantour et Alpi Marittime a été inaugurée le mercredi 28 janvier en présence de S.A.S le Prince Albert II de Monaco et se poursuivra jusqu’au 31 mai 2009.Les parcs du Mercantour et Alpi Marittime constituent un patrimoine naturel exceptionnel. Les engagements de la France, de l’Italie et de la Principauté de Monaco ont appelé, dans le cadre de la convention alpine, à la mise en œuvre d’un nouveau volet de coopération reflétant leur volonté partagée d’agir ensemble dans la valorisation transfrontalière de ces deux parcs.Ce nouveau volet de coopération s’est traduit par la signature d’une convention cadre le 19 septembre 2008 entre le Gouvernement Princier, la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco, le Parc National du Mercantour et le Parco Naturale delle Alpi Marittime.Ce partenariat permet d’unir les efforts sur plusieurs thèmes : l’inventaire généralisé de la biodiversité, l’inscription de cet espace commun au patrimoine mondial de l’UNESCO, la sensibilisation et la promotion de l’écotourisme.L’exposition « Nos Montagnes … » est une application de ce partenariat. Le talent des photographes, Jean Charles Vinaj, Cédric Robion et Claude Gouron est le meilleur des messages pour inviter à la découverte et sensibiliser à la protection de ces joyaux de la nature.

                   Mars 2008La haute mer est l'espace le moins connu et le moins exploré à ce jour. Bien public mondial par excellence, elle requiert une gestion coordonnée à l'échelle supra-étatique, dans le cadre d'une véritable gouvernance mondiale de l'environnement.Pourtant, la haute mer et ses ressources sont aujourd'hui de plus en plus menacées par l'intensité et la diversité des pressions anthropiques qu'elles supportent. Les récents débats menés au sein des différentes institutions impliquées dans le processus de réflexion sur la gouvernance de la haute mer ont soulevé plusieurs problématiques critiques d'ordre scientifique, juridique, institutionnel, économique dont le traitement apparaît être une nécessité impérieuse pour assurer la conservation de la biodiversité.Le séminaire a réuni des experts internationaux de haut niveau en vue d'éclairer le débat actuel, d'examiner les questions posant le plus de difficultés, et d'envisager des voies nouvelles pour une gestion durable des ressources de la haute mer.

                   2007- 2010En dépit de sa riche biodiversité endémique, Madagascar souffre d'une sévère déforestation et de la dégradation de ses ressources naturelles renouvelables. Cette situation est en partie due au manque de compréhension du fonctionnement des écosystèmes et à l’absence d’information et d’éducation concernant l’environnement.Le programme Clubs Vintsy vise à répondre à ces problèmes en sensibilisant les écoliers, étudiants et éducateurs, à travers la mise en place et l’animation d’un réseau national de clubs environnementaux.Le programme se compose de trois phases :- L’organisation et l’animation de Clubs Vintsy au sein d’écoles, avec des réunions publiques d’information pour les communautés locales, et des actions de sensibilisation.- La conception, l’édition et la distribution de matériaux techniques et de communication pour les écoliers participant au programme.- Une campagne de sensibilisation auprès des responsables au sein du Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale pour promouvoir la création de Clubs Vintsy et la formation des éducateurs.Plus de 450 clubs vintsy ont été créés dans le cadre du projet. Ce projet a permis la création d’un réseau dynamique et national de jeunes acteurs formés sur l’environnement.

                   2009- 2012L’archipel des îles Galápagos fait partie des réserves de biodiversité les plus riches au monde.La Fondation Charles Darwin a lancé un vaste programme scientifique, éducatif et économique qui vise à répertorier et cartographier la flore et la faune endémique de l’île  de Floréana. Le projet soutenu par la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco a pour objectif de créer un programme d’agriculture durable sur l’île ainsi que d’améliorer l’accès à l’eau potable et la gestion des déchets. Il permettra également d’intégrer les communautés locales aux actions de conservation en faveur de la biodiversité entreprises sur l’île. Le programme allie ainsi le développement économique durable pour les populations locales et la protection accrue des espèces endémiques de Floréana.

                   A partir d’information collectées par le Centre de données sur le patrimoine naturel (http://www.cdpnq.gouv.qc.ca) et basé sur diverses sources de données écologiques, ce projet a identifiera les « points chauds » de la biodiversité et du Québec Nordique.Les impacts et les capacités d’adaptation de la biodiversité au changement climatique seront prix en compte pour une aide à la décision du développement durable du Québec Nordique.Cet atlas appliqué au Québec nordique est une première et deviendra un outil incontournable de connaissances et de gestion de la biodiversité pour le projet gouvernemental intitutlé : « le Plan nord, un projet de développement durable du nord du 49e parrallèle jusqu’au 62e ». Il servira également de base pour la mise en place d’un futur réseau permanent de l’information et de suivi de la biodiversité du Québec.

                   2008-2011Le Honduras est l'un des pays les plus pauvres du continent américain. Cette pauvreté est notamment due à une faible productivité agricole, avec un usage et une gestion inadéquats des ressources naturelles (eau, sol et forêts).Le projet ONE DROP au Honduras vise à améliorer les conditions de vie des populations rurales grâce à :- la sécurité alimentaire des populations- une plus grande accessibilité à l'eau potable- l’appui à des activités économiques respectueuses de l'utilisation durable des ressources naturelles

                   Des bombes à retardement sous la mer… A partir des années 1912, les cartels de l’industrie et les régimes militaires d’une poignée de nations, notamment en Allemagne, les Etats-Unis, le Royaume-Uni, l’Italie, le Japon et l’URSS ont fabriqué d’énormes quantités de munitions remplies de substances mortelles comme le gaz moutarde ou des agents neurotoxiques encore plus destructeurs. D’immenses réserves d’armes inutilisées – bombes, obus, grenades, missiles et fûts de stockage remplis de produits toxiques -  ont été systématiquement larguées en mer jusqu’à que la pratique soit interdite en 1972. En tout, un million de tonnes d’armes chimiques provenant des deux guerres mondiales et de la Guerre froide ont été déversées dans les eaux profondes et peu profondes à travers le monde.Si le déversement de ces réserves mortelles dans nos océans a pu sembler un jour être la meilleur solution pour régler un problème de stockage, nous nous demandons aujourd’hui si il y a un danger pour l’écosystème et pour la santé humaine ?

                   2012 – 2014L’Himalaya, château d’eau de l’Asie, est la source des dix plus grands fleuves d’Asie qui sont la force vitale d’environ 40% de la population mondiale vivant dans ces bassins fluviaux. Les bassins fluviaux du Koshi et du Dangme, qui traversent le Népal et le Bhoutan, ont une importance considérable pour l’hydrologie de l’Himalaya oriental puisqu’ils permettent la vie d’une flore et d’une faune riches et diverses.Toutefois, les régimes en Himalaya se transforment, ce qui met en péril la production alimentaire, les investissements réalisés dans l’énergie hydroélectrique, la survie des plantes et des animaux, et la survie des communautés humaines.Ce projet vise à mettre en place un dispositif de gestion intégrée des ressources en eau. En créant des plateformes régionales, il rassemble tous les intervenants autour de débats sur les initiatives politiques et permet la diffusion des bonnes pratiques. Ce projet apporte une expérience de terrain très précieuse pour renforcer les politiques et les pratiques de gestion de l’eau aux niveaux local, national et régional.

                   2009 – 2013L’approche des « Villages du Millénaire » est une contribution innovante à la réalisation des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le Développement (OMD), d’autant que la situation d’extrême pauvreté du Mali rend particulièrement ardue l’atteinte de ces objectifs. Le projet consiste à mettre en œuvre, dans des villages, une stratégie et une planification des OMD par une approche intégrée de la recherche, de la formation et du partenariat global, tout en favorisant l’autonomie des populations concernées.L’objectif principal est d’apporter simultanément des investissements innovants dans les domaines de la santé, l’éducation, la production alimentaire, et l’accès à l’eau potable afin de sortir de la pauvreté et d’atteindre les OMD dans un délai de cinq ans.Le projet comporte deux volets : un volet qui a pour finalité la mise en place de deux « Villages du Millénaire » sur les sites pilotes de Toya et Tibi. L’autre volet vise à réaliser le déploiement des « Villages du Millénaire » à grande échelle sur les 166 communes du PNSA.

                   2009Le programme visait à réhabiliter et à assurer la gestion intégrée de la mare du village de Tolkoboye afin de préserver l’environnement et d’augmenter les revenus monétaires des populations avoisinantes. Le surcreusement de la mare a été réalisé avec succès et 1000 arbres ont été plantés en bordure de la mare.Parallèlement aux activités d’aménagement et de gestion de la mare, des activités de renforcement des capacités locales ont été menées afin que les populations soient à même de gérer leurs projets de développement. Un comité de gestion de 12 membres a été créé pour gérer le projet, et les villageois et les paysans ont reçus une formation technique. Deux activités de sensibilisation à l’égard des écoliers et des enseignants ont également été réalisées.

                   2008-2009Le projet a réuni des scientifiques de haut niveau en juillet 2009. Cette réunion rassemble des acteurs clés du domaine scientifique dans diverses disciplines relatives au sol et à la terre, dans le but de faire émerger des recommandations pour apporter des réponses aux besoins définis dans la Stratégie décennale adoptée en septembre 2007 à Madrid lors de la COP8 (Conférence des Parties). Après la COP9, les approches les plus envisageables pourraient faire l'objet de tests sur des projets pilotes.

                   2008-2009La population de Fiopko s’approvisionne en eau dans les sources et cours d’eau de la région. Avec l’explosion démographique, et l’arrivée de techniques d’agriculture intensive, ces sources subissent une très forte pression humaine et sont aujourd’hui polluées.Le projet d'approvisionnement en eau potable des agglomérations de Fiopko vise à satisfaire les besoins de ces populations en eau potable, tout en maintenant la qualité des systèmes naturels qui abritent les sources.

                   Phase I : 2008 – 2009Le but est d'aménager 100 hectares de bocage dans la région de Guiè au Burkina Faso. Ce périmètre, délimitant un territoire dans la savane, permet d'optimiser la surface agraire, de reboiser par la plantation de haies vives et de participer à la création d'un véritable bocage sahélien pour économiser le peu d'eau disponible pendant la période sèche dans cette région aride. L’eau est mieux préservée, ce qui permet une meilleure infiltration vers les nappes phréatiques. Elle est aussi mieux utilisée pour les cultures locales.Les principaux objectifs du projet sont :- la récupération de toutes les eaux pluviales sans érosion ;- la mise à disposition d'un cadre de travail pour les paysans qui assurent de bons rendements et une productivité durable ;- la régénération des sols grâce à la culture en zaï (la méthode consiste à creuser des micro cuvettes pendant la saison sèche, de novembre à mai), puis la mise en place d’un système de préservation des sols par une rotation culturale, incluant la jachère pâturée avec une clôture électrique qui sert également au parcage des animaux dans les champs après les récoltes.Phase II : 2011 – 2012Cette deuxième phase permet à Mission Enfance, de poursuivre l’aménagement de bocages dans la région d’Ouahigouya, au Nord du Burkina Faso.

                   2007-2008Le projet a permis le captage de quatre sources permanentes de montagne à des fins d'adduction d'eau potable gravitaire (sans pompe ni énergie) pour plus de 6000 personnes. Un bassin de maraîchage, un abreuvoir et un lavoir sont intégrés pour chacune des sources afin de favoriser l’hygiène et le développement d'activités économiques génératrices de revenus et d'emplois (création de 200 emplois directs et indirects).

                   2007-2009Le rejet des eaux usées dans les rivières sans traitement cause de nombreux problèmes de maladies, de décès, de pertes économiques, de pollution de l’environnement et de détérioration des écosystèmes. Bangkok et Makati, ont mis en place un système de traitements des déchets liquides peu coûteux et décentralisé. Fortes de ces expériences, elles se sont positionnées en villes mentor pour aider d’autres villes à améliorer leur système d’assainissement.Le projet s’appuie sur leurs expériences afin d’en faire bénéficier les villes de Palembang (Indonésie), San Fernando (Philippines), et de Negombo (Sri Lanka).Deux systèmes Ecotanks ont été installés dans chacune des villes bénéficiaires au niveau des zones pilotes (résidences, gare routière, plage, etc.). La viabilité du projet est assurée par le fait que les villes elles-mêmes ont investi financièrement dans le projet.

                   2011-2014Le rhinocéros de Java fait partie des grands mammifères terrestres les plus menacés. Aujourd’hui, cette espèce ne survit plus que dans le Parc National d’Ujung Kulon en Indonésie. Une récente étude a montré qu’il ne subsistait qu’une cinquantaine d’individus : l’espèce n’est aujourd’hui plus en mesure de se renouveler et sans une aide humaine, la population ne peut plus augmenter d’elle-même.L’objectif de l’IRF est de créer une zone de 4000 hectares située dans la continuité de la zone du parc national et destinée à la protection et à la recherche sur le rhinocéros de Java.L’agrandissement de sa zone d’habitat dans le Parc National d’Ujung Kulon doit permettre à la population de rhinocéros de se renouveler et favoriser l’opportunité de transporter des individus vers cette deuxième zone de protection pour créer une souche nouvelle de population.

                   2012-2013La Réserve de Biosphère Maya (MBR) au Guatemala est la plus vaste région protégée d’Amérique centrale et l’une des réserves de la biodiversité les plus riches. Elle joue un rôle crucial dans la conservation de la biodiversité en atténuant les impacts potentiels du changement climatique, en piégeant des millions de tonnes de carbone et en fournissant des services écosystémiques comme la production d’eau douce.Ce programme propose de mettre en place des mesures incitatives, financières et techniques, en contrepartie d’engagements explicites de conservation des régions clés de la MBR. Il soutient le financement d’un accord de mesures incitatives pilotes dans plusieurs villages de la région.

                   2011-2013En Chine, la destruction et la dégradation des forêts, ainsi que la croissance démographique, ont entraîné un déclin sans précédent de la population des tigres de l'Amour dans le Nord-est du pays. Actuellement, il ne subsiste qu’une vingtaine d’individus, c’est-à-dire à peine un dixième de la population des années 1950.Près de 38 500 km2 ont été identifiés comme constituant l’habitat potentiel de ce tigre. Le but de ce projet est l’établissement d’une zone prioritaire de conservation du tigre (TPA) dans la zone d’Hunchun-Wangqing-Dongning, dans le nord-est de la Chine.

                   2010Le parc W, parc naturel de plus d’un million d’hectares, s’étend sur trois pays : le Bénin, le Burkina-Faso et le Niger. Cela fait plus de 30 ans que l’emblématique léopard (Panthera pardus) n’a plus été officiellement observé dans la partie nigérienne du parc (330 000 hectares).Le but de ce projet est d’enquêter sur la présence du léopard dans le parc en mobilisant les guides et les populations locales. Le projet a permis la formation pratique de 6 agents forestiers et 18 éco-gardes au pistage selon les standards CyberTracker, et la formation pratique et théorique de 24 guides du Parc W.

                   2009-2010« The End of the Line » est un documentaire dramatique traitant de la crise de la surpêche. Très médiatisé au Royaume-Uni, il a été surnommé « An  inconvenient truth for the ocean » par le magazine « The Economist ».  Suite à sa diffusion, de grandes chaînes de restaurants ont annoncé le changement de leurs habitudes concernant la provenance de leurs produits à base de poissons.La prise de conscience des consommateurs sur ce sujet est aujourd’hui faible, et des efforts considérables sont à faire.  Le milieu politique en particulier doit être sensibilisé, pour que des mesures concrètes et règlementaires soient mises en œuvre, comme l’instauration de quotas de pêche, ou la création de sanctuaires marins où la pêche serait interdite.

                   2010 – 2013Protection et conservation du chameau de Bactriane, considéré comme « en danger critique d’extinction » par l’IUCN. Cet animal extraordinaire est le seul mammifère à pouvoir boire de l’eau salée.Des scientifiques chinois et internationaux collaborent sur ce projet afin de comprendre l’impact de la désertification sur l’habitat et sur les ressources en eau et en nourriture pour le chameau sauvage de Bactriane.Le projet a déjà permis de créer une large zone de protection dans le désert de Gobi dans lequel 650 chameaux ont déjà été répertoriés. Une nouvelle zone de protection dans le désert de Mongolie devrait bientôt voir le jour

                   2012 – 2017Le projet, mené par la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco, aux côtés du Tethys Research Institute, de la Hellenic Society for the Study and Protection of the Monk Seal et du WWF Grèce, vise à créer et déployer un Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) dans la région côtière autour de l’Ile de Gyaros. Le phoque moine est l'un des mammifères les plus menacés dans le monde et on estime que seuls 450 à 510 individus sont encore vivants. Les deux principales menaces pour la conservation du phoque moine en Méditerranée sont les interactions négatives avec les pêcheries (comme la destruction des filets par exemple) entraînant parfois l’abattage volontaire de l’animal, ainsi que la dégradation de l’habitat de l’espèce.L'étude de faisabilité réalisée en 2011 a permis de jeter les bases du projet. Plusieurs séances de travail avec les meilleurs spécialistes internationaux sur ce sujet ont eu lieu dans la Principauté au cours des dernières années.Le statut «Natura 2000» de l'île Gyaros est une grande opportunité à la fois pour les phoques moines et pour les pêcheurs locaux. L'habitat des phoques moines sera préservé et les pêcheurs locaux bénéficieront d'un renouvellement des stocks de poissons. La Fondation Prince Albert II travaillera avec ses partenaires techniques pour une période de 5 ans afin de protéger les espèces grâce à la mise en place d'une Aire Marine Protégée. La Fondation Prince Albert II sensibilisera les acteurs locaux, en particulier les pêcheurs, afin qu'ils comprennent et acceptent la future zone de protection marine et participent à la protection de cette espèce emblématique de la Méditerranée.Le projet est déjà soutenu par la Fondation Blue Marine et par la Commission européenne dans le cadre du mécanisme de financement LIFE + Nature. C'est une grande réussite pour le projet phoque moine puisque seulement 4 projets LIFE+ Nature ont été approuvés par la Commission européenne en Grèce, et 92 projets dans les 27 États membres de l'UE.

Ils peuvent être situés sur les balcons des habitats verticaux et dans les cours d’établissements scolaires.Un guide méthodologique a été réalisé afin que le projet puisse être reproduit dans d’autres villes françaises.

                   2008 - 2011L’apogon des îles Banggaï, petit poisson marin de la famille des apogonidae, est une espèce endémique de l’Archipel des îles Banggaï. Du fait de sa beauté et de son mode de reproduction original, l’espèce est très appréciée par les aquariophiles du monde entier. Chaque année, ce sont plus de 900 000 individus par an qui sont exportés en Europe, au Japon et aux Etats-Unis.Aujourd’hui, de nombreuses menaces pèsent sur les stocks sauvages comme la surpêche qui alimente le marché aquariophile ou la destruction des habitats.L’objectif de ce programme était de contribuer à la conservation de l’apogon des îles Banggaï à travers des actions de recherches, de mise en place de mesure de protection et de sensibilisation des populations.

                   2008-2010Le thon rouge méditerranéen est en voie d'extinction, en raison d’une surpêche non contrôlée et de sérieuses lacunes dans les données scientifiques disponibles pour en améliorer la gestion, notamment sur la capacité migratoire des populations. Ce projet vise à développer des techniques de pêche et des habitudes de consommation responsables, ainsi qu’à établir un label pour les marchés japonais et européens.Il est également question de mettre en place un sanctuaire pour préserver les dernières frayères du thon de toute activité humaine. Enfin, une campagne positive destinée aux pays membres de l’ICCAT (Commission Internationale pour la Conservation du Thon en Atlantique) est réalisée pour le respect des quotas de pêche de thons rouge, afin de leur permettre d'allouer la moitié de leurs quotas nationaux à la conservation.

                   2011 - 2014L’impact des pêcheries industrielles et des changements climatiques sur les albatros et les pétrels constitue un problème de conservation majeur. La plupart de ces espèces sont actuellement considérées comme menacées d’extinction.Après un premier programme qui a duré 4 ans ( entre 2007 et 2010) visant à améliorer les connaissances sur la distribution de ces oiseaux marins menacés d’extinction en relation avec les conditions environnementales et les pêcheries, un deuxième programme a vu le jour afin d’adosser au projet actuel des moyens complémentaires  qui permettraient d’en améliorer la valorisation en approfondissant l’analyse des résultats acquis.D’une durée de 3 ans, ce programme permettra de modéliser la sensibilité actuelle et future des populations d’albatros de l’océan Austral aux changements climatiques et aux pêcheries et ainsi proposer des mesures de conservation en mer opérationnelles au niveau des pêcheries et des états par la proposition d’aires marines à protéger.

                   Mai 2007 – Mai 2010Des recherches in situ sur les espèces menacées sont menées au sein du Centre. Les infrastructures permettent l’accueil et l’élevage d’espèces animales menacées. Un centre d’information permet d’accueillir et sensibiliser les populations locales ainsi que les touristes, très présents dans cette zone du pays.De plus, des mesures visant à mettre en valeur le développement durable des ressources naturelles sont développées afin de promouvoir l’apiculture, l’utilisation de l’énergie solaire et la production et la vente d’artisanat local.La faune et la flore cambodgienne sont dans de meilleures conditions que dans la plupart des autres pays de l’Asie du sud-est. Néanmoins, elles connaissent aujourd’hui un déclin significatif dû braconnage, au commerce et à l’exploitation forestière. De plus, le pays manque de ressources humaines, de lois et d’expertises pour gérer efficacement les problèmes de conservation de la biodiversité. Le centre pour la Conservation de la Biodiversité d’Angkor (ACCB) est le premier centre de conservation de la nature au Cambodge.

Leur habitat est soumis à une déforestation intense pour l’approvisionnement en bois de la ville de Niamey.Le projet a pour objectif l’actualisation des données éthologiques et scientifiques des girafes, la formation de deux agents forestiers et de six animateurs à l’éducation environnementale, la cartographie de leur occupation de l’espace et la prise de connaissance des besoins de la filière bois afin d’empêcher la disparition de leur habitat.

                   2007-2009Il y a 100 ans que le dernier gypaète barbu des Alpes était abattu. Ce rapace, le plus grand d’Europe, est aussi l’une des huit espèces d’oiseaux les plus menacées du continent.Un programme de réintroduction de ce rapace a démarré en 1989 dans les Alpes : le Parco Naturale Alpi Marittime et le Parc National du Mercantour y sont investis conjointement depuis 1993, et la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco les a rejoints depuis 2007.En 2007, ce programme a été couronné par la naissance du premier gypaète barbu en milieu naturel dans la vallée de l’Ubaye, au nord du Parc du Mercantour.Cette naissance symbolise un équilibre naturel retrouvé et la perspective d’une population alpine viable pour cette espèce emblématique.

                   2007 – 2012L'aigle de Bonelli est l'un des rapaces les plus menacés en Europe. En France, il a connu une forte période de régression durant laquelle ses effectifs sont passés de 80 couples dans les années 1960 à 23 en 2002. Depuis ces trois dernières années, la situation s’est inversée : en effet, la population française d’aigles de Bonelli augmente désormais au rythme d’un couple par an. Elle est estimée aujourd’hui à 31 couples.Dans le cadre du premier plan de restauration en faveur de l’espèce, dont la coordination nationale a été confiée au CEN-LR par la DREAL Languedoc Roussillon, la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco soutient la Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux dans le cadre d’un programme d'élevage en captivité de jeunes aigles, afin de soutenir des programmes de renforcement de populations en Europe, en Espagne notamment. Le suivi des oiseaux lâchés est réalisé à partir de balises et d'émetteurs spécifiques.

                   2013 Tara Expéditions agit depuis 2003 en faveur de l’environnement et de la recherche grâce à un bateau mythique, Tara, taillé pour les conditions extrêmes.De mai à novembre, Tara réalise une navigation autour de l'Océan Arctique par les passages du Nord Est et du Nord Ouest. La plupart des scientifiques et instituts impliqués dans Tara Oceans, accompagnent le projet pour étudier l'écosystème polaire marin et compléter le travail effectué depuis 2009. S'ajoutent aussi de nouveaux programmes de recherche spécifiques à cette région, sur les particules de plastique ou sur les traces de polluants.L'expédition a également une visée politique en mettant sur le devant de la scène une région au coeur de la machine climatique mondiale.

                   2010 – 2015Students on Ice est un projet international qui permet à des jeunes étudiants du monde entier de participer à un séjour de sensibilisation dans les régions polaires, en étant accompagnés d’éducateurs et de scientifiques. Chaque année, la Fondation Prince Albert II en partenariat avec l’Education Nationale de la Jeunesse et des Sports de Monaco, soutient le concours « Un lycéen an Arctique » ouvert aux élèves volontaires des classes de première de la Principauté. Les élèves primés dans les deux catégories de « photo » et « expression écrite » intègrent le groupe de l’association « Students on Ice » pour un voyage de 15 jours en Arctique.Cette expérience offre aux étudiants, accompagné d’éducateurs et de scientifiques, une opportunité de mieux comprendre notre planète et de découvrir un milieu naturel des plus préservés, hors des sentiers battus. Six étudiants des écoles de Monaco ont ainsi pu s’éveiller aux impacts du réchauffement climatique dans ces régions si riches en biodiversité et pourtant si vulnérables.

                   2009-2011L’augmentation de température et de CO2 due aux activités humaines représente une menace majeure pour l’environnement. La moitié du CO2 produit par l’homme durant les 200 dernières années a été absorbée par l’océan. Cette augmentation de CO2 engendre le phénomène connu d’acidification des océans qui a un impact majeur sur la formation des coraux.La Méditerranée est une mer semi-fermée et se comporte comme un océan miniature, répondant plus vite aux changements de température. C’est donc un point chaud où les taux d’acidification sont critiques.Si beaucoup d’études ont déjà été réalisées sur les coraux tropicaux, aucune donnée n’existe sur les coraux d’eaux profondes en Méditerranée. Ces coraux représentent pourtant un écosystème unique à des profondeurs où la biodiversité se fait rare. Ce projet est donc consacré aux effets du réchauffement et de l’acidification sur les coraux vivant en eaux profondes.Les excès de nos émissions dans l’atmosphère ont un impact jusque dans les profondeurs de nos océans et notamment sur les coraux de Méditerranée. Ce projet permet de prévoir l’évolution future de ce milieu. Des pistes d’action seront alors proposées pour mieux préserver cet écosystème riche et fragile.

                   Du 22 octobre au 9 janvier 2013Ce projet, porté par l’association Pôles Actions a regroupé deux évènements dédiés au plus populaire des habitants de l’Arctique. En quelques années, l’Ours polaire est en effet passé d’un relatif anonymat à une médiatisation sans précédent. Symbole des changements climatiques planétaires, il est touché de plein fouet par la disparition progressive de son habitat, la banquise, et fait ainsi l’objet de nombreuses prises de position et de déclarations, pas toujours fondées sur des bases scientifiques objectives.Un colloque scientifique s’est ainsi tenu les 22 et 23 octobre 2012 à Institut Océanographique de Paris. Des généticiens, des glaciologues, des biologistes canadien, norvégien, danois et français se sont réunis, permettant de faire le point sur les connaissances actuelles de l’espèce, son environnement, l’avenir de ses populations et ses relations avec l’Homme sous les latitudes septentrionales de notre planète.t suite à ce colloque, une exposition en Principauté de Monaco, inaugurée  par le Prince Albert II le 16 novembre 2012, a permis de sensibiliser le grand public à l’importance de la préservation de l’espèce et à l’impact du changement climatique sur son habitat.

                   2010 – 2012L’Arctic Futures Symposium a pour but de réunir des représentants des pays du Conseil de l’Arctique, de l’Union Européenne et d’autres parties intéressés afin de discuter des questions liées à l’avenir de l’Arctique. Le symposium permet aux différents intervenants de discuter de leurs besoins, de leurs positions et ainsi partager leur savoir-faire dans cette région d’une importance vitale.Depuis 2010, en conjonction avec la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco et l’Institut Aspen, l’International Polar Foundation (IPF) a accueilli trois éditions de l’Arctic Futures Symposium à Bruxelles. Chaque année, différents thèmes sont abordés comme le changement climatique, la recherche, les perspectives d’avenir de l’Arctique ou la promotion de la connaissance, des responsabilités et des engagements envers cette région.

                   2011 - 2013Devant les impacts du changement climatique, de nombreuses activités dans les zones polaires doivent évoluer pour perdurer. Les éleveurs de rennes, en particulier, doivent faire face à ce changement qui impacte aussi la biodiversité. La protection des territoires naturels et la continuité de l’évolution des conditions de vie des populations sont les deux défis auxquels le Centre International des Eleveurs de Rennes tente de répondre, en mettant en œuvre plusieurs activités, notamment le développement de la recherche, de l’éducation et de l’information des éleveurs circumpolaires.Le projet vise également à favoriser les contacts et les échanges entre ces bénéficiaires. Il est aussi un moyen de recruter des jeunes gens locaux pour des travaux scientifiques, en mettant en place un système éducatif compétent et attractif.

                   7 au 9 Septembre 2008La conférence a considéré les questions relatives aux quatre thèmes suivants :- défis pour la protection de la biodiversité et du désert dans les régions polaires- développement durable et droits de l’Homme- gouvernance environnementale dans les régions polaires- questions juridiques, nouvelles et préexistantes dans les régions polairesDes experts de renommée internationale du droit international et de la politique étrangère relatifs aux régions polaires ont présenté leurs points de vue sur les solutions à donner à la suite de l’Année Polaire Internationale. La conférence à répondu aux questions suivantes : Quels sont, pour ce qui concerne les régions polaires, les enjeux nouveaux ou préexistants qui justifient une action internationale en matière de droit et de politique ? Les systèmes juridiques et politiques actuels permettent-ils de traiter ces problèmes ? Quels sont ceux qui exigent l’action immédiate de la communauté internationale ? Lesquels nécessiteront l’action de la communauté internationale à long terme ? Quelles démarches les Etats doivent-ils entreprendre pour répondre à ces problématiques ? Quels sont les domaines qui suscitent une recherche approfondie par des spécialistes juridiques et ceux des autres disciplines ? Les solutions impliquent l’établissement d’une série de recommandations aux gouvernements selon les différentes étapes répertoriées dans un rapport publié par l’Université des Nations Unies et distribué aux points focaux en charge des affaires polaires, et dans la plaquette universitaire publiée dans l’almanach du droit polaire des éditions Brill.

                   Cet événement scientifique en ligne (et donc en grande partie carbone-neutre) a proposé des approches, des méthodes, des stratégies et d’autres types d’actions nécessaires pour faire face au défi du changement climatique.La première conférence en ligne « Climate 2008 / Klima 2008 » était composée d’une conférence scientifique et d’une discussion impliquant le grand public. De plus, un forum de discussion a regroupé des chercheurs et des politiciens qui ont examiné les différentes manières pour faire face au changement climatique.L’objectif était de :- présenter les derniers résultats de la recherche scientifique sur le changement climatique, y compris ceux liés aux aspects environnementaux, sociaux, économique et politiques- proposer des projets et d’autres initiatives prises dans les pays industrialisés et en voie de développement par le biais des universités, des institutions scientifiques, des gouvernements et des ONG.La Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco a continué à soutenir les autres conférences Climate/Klima.

                   2008 – 2012 L’objectif du projet est de détecter et d’évaluer les effets de la tropicalisation de la mer Méditerranée à l’aide de macro-descripteurs  biologiques du réchauffement climatique qui sont à la fois fiables et représentatifs.Le projet met en œuvre un suivi systématique à long terme et sur le terrain, d’espèces clés et sensibles aux changements de température.Ces changements sont mis en relation avec des données satellitaires et des mesures de température de la mer enregistrées par des sondes spéciales installées dans plusieurs zones clés du bassin méditerranéen.Le soutien de la Fondation permet au CIESM d’ouvrir de nouvelles perspectives sur la diversité et la dynamique des espèces de la Méditerranée et d’établir les bases d’un réseau international de surveillance et d’alerte à long terme pour détecter les modifications de la biodiversité méditerranéenne face aux changements globaux.

                   2007-2009Les ours polaires sont menacés d’extinction. Ils sont pourtant un indicateur clé pour suivre l’état du biotope arctique et des changements qui l’influencent.Présenté dans le cadre de l'Année Polaire Internationale, ce projet propose d’étudier l'état de santé des ours polaires à l'échelle circumpolaire, en se basant sur l’étude combinée des effets physiologiques des polluants et de l’impact de la destruction de leur habitat due au réchauffement climatique.Cette étude met en évidence les effets des polluants sur l’ours polaire et précise la nature des sources de contamination.En parallèle, les aptitudes d’adaptation de cette espèce face au réchauffement climatique en Arctique sont évaluées grâce à des balises satellitaires.

In situ conservation of indigenous tree species in Southern Cameroon

Of additional concern is the immediate threat posed by the loss of tree cover and diversity to the sustainability of local land use systems, due to the breakdown of traditional interdependencies between on-farm and off-farm environments, such as in the use of off-farm non-forest tree products to support farm livelihoods.
Past research in the Forest Margins Benchmark Area (FMBA) of southern Cameroon has revealed a South-North gradient of resource use intensification associated with increasing demographic pressure and better market access. Whereas the social and economic implications of such changes have been extensively studied, their consequences on the environment, though broadly acknowledged, are yet still not entirely understood. In particular, the impacts of changing land use mosaics on the distribution and abundance of plant diversity in various land use types are uncertain. Predictions of future biological diversity on shortened fallow lands and other anthropogenic habitats range widely, and the uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to take effective policy action and to communicate the scientific issues to policy makers, the media and the public. One of the major causes of uncertainty is inadequate knowledge of how and why changing land use mosaics have adverse effects on biodiversity components, particularly the distribution and abundance of indigenous species which local poor farmers value for many purposes. Although various research programmes conducted in the area have acknowledged the need to give more attention to the development of tools and approaches for assessing the effects of resource use intensification on the global environment, current scientific understanding of these processes does not permit adequate design of effective strategies.Outputs:  ",NA,NA,"http://www.darwininitiative.org.uk/project/EIDPJ007/","170","EIDPJ007","1,520.00",TRUE

It is likely that this will involve the inclusion of new modules in the UoL undergraduate curriculum to bring it in line with international standards. In addition, we will explore the potential for the creation of a Centre of Excellence for Ecological Research and Conservation Learning in Sapo, Liberia’s only National Park, facilitating access of both students and FDA recruits to practical field and research experience. 

Planned  activities
1.	Initial meeting of scoping mission steering committee to be held with representatives from FFI, UL and FDA to discuss goals and roles of participating organisations. 
2.	Review the current UL undergraduate curriculum for forestry to give a clearer understanding of course aims and content.
3.	Conduct undergraduate and graduate forester’s skills needs assessment 
4.	Develop ideas for addressing skills training gaps through the inclusion of new undergraduate modules.
5.	Develop on outline of the role of the Centre of Excellence for Ecological Research and Conservation Learning
